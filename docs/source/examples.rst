pySROS data structures
######################

Having made a connection to an SR OS device it is important to understand the data structures returned by the
:py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.get` function and those that can be sent to a router using
:py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set`.

As described in the :ref:`pysros-data-model` section, data obtained from and sent to an SR OS device are described
in a format referred to as a pySROS data structure.

This section provides some example outputs of the data structures for the respective YANG constructs.

.. _pysros-examples-list-structure:

YANG list structure
*******************

A YANG list is represented as a Python dict, as noted in the :ref:`pysros-data-model` section.

YANG lists define three elements:

- a list name
- a list key
- a set of key-values

The YANG module :ref:`example-yang` shown below, demonstrates this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/example.yang
   :caption: example.yang
   :name: example-yang
   :language: yang

The key of the YANG list (``listkey``) is a child element of the list (``listname``)
itself.  Without knowledge of the structure of the specific YANG list, a developer would need to have an external
reference to be able to identify the key of the list to iterate through it or to reference specific items.
For this reason, the pySROS libraries translate YANG lists into Python dictionaries keyed on the values of the list
key (``listkey``) as opposed to Python lists.

The element ``/nokia-conf:configure/log/log-id`` is a YANG list in the ``nokia-conf`` YANG module.  The YANG list name
is ``log-id`` and the YANG list's key is ``name``.

.. note::

   The key of a YANG list can be identified using context-sensitive help within SR OS, from the YANG module or by
   obtaining the ``pwc json-instance-path`` of an element in the YANG list, for example,
   ``/nokia-conf:configure/log/log-id[name="10"]``.

Consider the following router configuration:

.. code-block:: none
   :name: sros-example-log-config
   :caption: SR OS example log configuration

   /configure log log-id "10" { }
   /configure log log-id "10" { description "Log ten" }
   /configure log log-id "11" { }
   /configure log log-id "11" { description "Log eleven" }

If this list is obtained using :py:meth:`pysros.Datastore.get` for the list ``log-id``, the resultant data structure
is a Python dictionary, keyed on the values of the ``log-id`` list's key, ``name``:

.. code-block:: python
   :name: yang-list-py3-struct-data-ex1
   :caption: Obtaining the data from a YANG list data structure
   :emphasize-lines: 5-6

   >>> from pysros.management import connect
   >>> c = connect()
   >>> data = c.running.get('/nokia-conf:configure/log/log-id')
   >>> data
   {'10': Container({'description': Leaf('Log ten'), 'name': Leaf('10')}),
    '11': Container({'description': Leaf('Log eleven'), 'name': Leaf('11')})}

Configuring YANG lists
----------------------
YANG lists may be configured using the pySROS libraries in many ways.

Assume the target configuration of the ``log-id`` list on SR OS is in the :ref:`sros-example-log-config` as shown in the preceding example.

This is a YANG list named ``log-id``, with one key name (``name``) and two key-values, ``10`` and ``11``.

Method 1
^^^^^^^^

Configure the list with a payload that is a Python dictionary keyed on the YANG list key-value:

.. code-block:: python
   :name: yang-list-py3-set-ex1
   :caption: Configure YANG list using Python dict payload without key name
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3

   >>> c = connect()
   >>> path = '/nokia-conf:configure/log/log-id'
   >>> payload = {'10': {'description': 'Log ten'}, '11': {'description': 'Log eleven'}}
   >>> c.candidate.set(path, payload)


Method 2
^^^^^^^^

Configure the specific items in the list with a payload that is a Python dictionary containing the contents
of that list item *without* the key name and key-value information (The list's key name and key-value are supplied
in the ``path``).

.. code-block:: python
   :name: yang-list-py3-set-ex2
   :caption: Configure each YANG list entry in turn providing the key and key-value in the path
   :emphasize-lines: 2, 4-5

   >>> c = connect()
   >>> list_entries = [("10", "Log ten"), ("11", "Log eleven")]
   >>> for item in list_entries:
   >>>     payload = {'description': item[1]}
   >>>     path = '/nokia-conf:configure/log/log-id[name=' + item[0] + ']'
   >>>     c.candidate.set(path, payload)


Method 3
^^^^^^^^

Configure the specific items in the list with a payload that is a Python dictionary containing the contents
of that list item *with* the key name and key-value information provided (The list's key name and key-value are
also supplied in the ``path``).  In this case, the contents of the payload dictionary for key name and key-value
**must** match the data provided in the ``path``.

.. code-block:: python
   :name: yang-list-py3-set-ex3
   :caption: Configure each YANG list entry in turn providing the key and key-value in the path *and* payload
   :emphasize-lines: 2, 4-5

   >>> c = connect()
   >>> list_entries = [("10", "Log ten"), ("11", "Log eleven")]
   >>> for item in list_entries:
   >>>     payload = {'name': item[0], 'description': item[1]}
   >>>     path = '/nokia-conf:configure/log/log-id[name=' + item[0] + ']'
   >>>     c.candidate.set(path, payload)

YANG user-ordered list structure
********************************
A user-ordered list is similar to a :ref:`pysros-examples-list-structure`.

Python dictionaries are not order aware.  This is not important for most configuration items in the SR OS
model-driven interfaces as SR OS ensures the required order is identified and achieved automatically.
However, some specific lists in SR OS are order dependent, such as policies.

User-ordered lists are therefore represented as ordered dictionaries in Python.
